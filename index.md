We share knowledge and information about aquatic microbial ecology. The goal of the Aquatic Microbiome Research Initiative (AMRI) is to engage leading researchers in Sweden with backgrounds in microbial ecology, evolution and geochemistry, in a collaborative effort to advance our understanding of aquatic microorganisms and their functional role in the environment.
